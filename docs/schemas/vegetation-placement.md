# Vegetation placement asset, version 1

`tidewater.vegetation-placement/1` is a compact binary asset used by the island's `tidewater.procedural-island-vegetation/1` component. Its SHA-256 covers the entire byte sequence; the owner references that hash as `placementAssetId` in the signed world manifest. The asset is advertised with kind `vegetation-placement/1` and priority `portal-preview`, so an open portal can prepare the plants before handoff. It contains placement data only. Geometry, materials, impostors, wind, and shaders remain client code; the grass mask remains generated from the island terrain.

All integers and floats are little-endian. Version 1 layout:

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 bytes | ASCII `TVP1` magic and format version |
| 4 | `uint32` | Component seed; currently `7` |
| 8 | `uint32` | Number of village palms, 0–10 |
| 12 | `uint32` | Plant-kind count; must be 10 |
| 16 | 10 × `uint32` | Record counts in the kind order below |
| 56 | Variable | Groups of fixed-width placement records, in the same kind order |

The kind order is `palms`, `trees`, `bananas`, `shrubs`, `youngPalms`, `ferns`, `monsteras`, `elephantEars`, `heliconias`, `strelitzias`. Each record is 41 bytes: one flags byte followed by ten `float32` values `[x, y, z, s, sy, yaw, la, l, H, seed]`. Flag bit 0 indicates that `sy` was authored; when clear, the `sy` slot must be ignored. Other flag bits are reserved and must be zero.

Readers reject unknown counts, non-finite values, positions outside ±10,000 m, scales outside `(0, 100]`, per-kind counts above 100,000, total counts above 200,000, incorrect lengths, and records whose per-instance seed is outside `[0, 1]`. Do not add fields in place: define a new protocol version for an incompatible layout. Keep the checked-in generator deterministic and verify the content hash when exporting or serving the asset.
